## Overview

**Project Title**: Hangman Game in Rust

**Project Description**: 
This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game using Rust. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game demonstrates the use of Rust's fundamental features such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, data structures, and object-oriented programming with `struct` and `impl`.

**Project Goals**: 
- To develop a command-line application in Rust.
- To demonstrate the use of Rust programming features and best practices.
- To create a fun and interactive game for users.

## Instructions for Build and Use

**Steps to build and/or run the software:**

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure Rust is installed on your system. If not, install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd hangman_game
4. Build and run the game using Cargo:
   ```sh
   cargo run

**Instructions for using the software:**

1. Once the game starts, you will see a message welcoming you to Hangman.
2. The game will display the hidden word with underscores representing unguessed letters.
3. Enter your guesses one letter at a time when prompted.
4. The game will inform you whether your guess was correct or incorrect.
5. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
6. The game will display a win or loss message at the end.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

*Rust - Version 1.50 or higher
*Cargo - Rust's package manager and build system
